# LEGACY: sparrow-frame-splitter
 Splits individual sparrow atlas frames to bitmaps, and saves them as a group.
 replace "sheet.png" and "sheet.xml" in the assets/images folder with the atlas you want to split, and update "anims.txt" to have the animations you wanna export.

 NOTE: Current version of the source code is a very incomplete update. If you want to alter it, I'd suggest using the 1.0 release's source code.
